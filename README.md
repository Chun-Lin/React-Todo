This is a TODO app created with [create-react-app]('https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app')

## request.js is a file for fetching api data, and I have already set the API_HOST within ./constants/index.js, all you need to do is import HOST domain from ./constants/index.js

### To execute the project, you just need to follow two steps below:

1. set up json-server
``` 
json-server --watch db.json --port 3004
```

2. `npm start` or `yarn start`
